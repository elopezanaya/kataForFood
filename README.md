# kataForFood

I will be using this repo for some new Katas I found, 

The first one is to identify is a string has only unique chars, I know there is a version using bitwise with XOR, but meh...

The second kata is to identify if the left side of a binary tree is a mirror of the right side.

check the tests , any question or comment please let me know.
